# Dragon Smaug (UMD bundle)

Small snake game packaged as a UMD bundle for direct inclusion in the browser.

## Usage

1. Include the UMD bundle in your page:

```html
<script src="/path/to/dist/dragon-smaug.umd.js"></script>
```

2. Mount the game on an element and start it:

```html
<div id="game"></div>
<script>
  const game = DragonSmaug.mount('#game', {
    cols: 24,
    rows: 18,
    speedMs: 110,
    onGameOver(score) { console.log('Final score:', score); }
  });
  game.start();
</script>
```

## Controls

- Arrow keys or WASD: move the snake
- R: restart after Game Over

## Example

See `example/index.html` for a small usage example.

## Auto cell sizing

If you omit the `cell` option when calling `DragonSmaug.mount(...)`, the UMD bundle will compute a sensible `cell` value automatically based on the container size and the requested `cols`/`rows`. This helps the game fit various screen sizes without manual tuning. The computed cell is clamped to a reasonable range.

## Recommended container styling

For best results it's recommended to give the mounting element some constraints so the game can scale predictably. Add a small CSS rule for the container element (here `#game`) in your page or global stylesheet. Example:

```css
#game { max-width: 95vmin; margin: 0 auto; max-height: 75vmin; }
```

This keeps the canvas from growing too large on very wide/large screens and centers it horizontally. Adjust the values to taste for your layout or replace `#game` with the selector you mount to.
